# Driver Licence Theory Racer (DLT Racer)
DLT Racer is a gamification of practicing driver's license theory test of the UK. My goal on this project is to make it easier to study your theory test and even make it fun to do!

Normal theory practice apps are so strait and have no fun in it. And studying for a driver theory test is boring as hell! DLT Racer challenges you with a game. The game is available **[on Google Play Store!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.BabaApp.DLTRacer)**

## The Game
The game is simple! Your racing car is moving on a busy road and your answer will lead your car to the line of your choice. If you choose the first option, the car will move to the first line on the road. If that was the wrong answer, **BAAM, you crashed into another vehicle!** But if it was the correct answer, the line will be empty.

And **you have limited fuel (time)** to answer the question. If you can't answer it in time, your current line will be busy and you'll face an accident! You have **10 questions and 3 lives** to complete the race!

## Key Features
- The game has 14 sections and  700 revision questions from the DVSA.
- Every section has many levels to complete.
- Each level has 10 questions and up to 3 stars rating.
- The order of questions is random.
- Has ads after each challenge.
## Challenges and Implementation
I wrote the game in **C# with Unity Engine**. This is my very first game and it was not a simple game, or maybe even a game at all.

The first challenge that I had was **merging a game structure with a question-answer app structure**. This design and its implementation were difficult to set up and there was nothing on the internet that I can take as an example.

Then I implemented **ads** in it after each level. In this way, I could generate some revenue to hire someone to improve the app.

The last challenge in this app was the **Google Play Store**. They require specific settings and implementation. But I did manage to make Google happy about it.
## Results
The game didn't start well. Almost nobody installed it except a couple of my friends even though I've spent $100 on advertisements in specific areas of London. The main audience of these kind of apps are foreigners and I targeted them. But not much result.

Then I left the app behind, in production. Today (August 2023) **the app had 201 downloads, 11 reviews, and 5.0 points!**

I see it as a success because the app had many missing features but I released it to see the results. After the results, I left it as it was. For its current situation, 201 downloads, 11 reviews, and 5.0 points is a score for me :)
